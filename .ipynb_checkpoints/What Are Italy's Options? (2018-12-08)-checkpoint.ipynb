But others, including the Bank of Italy and the Peterson Institute of International Economics, warn that Italy is caught in a trap: Anxieties about debt sustainability mean that any stimulus has the perverse effect of driving up interest rates, squeezing bank lending and reducing growth...\n",

    "Back in the late 1990s Paul Krugman concluded that workings of the macroeconomy had changed: that we had started to see _The Return of Depression Economics_ <https://books.google.com/books?isbn=039304839X>. He was right. This meant that the economic analytical tools that had been forged in order to understand the Great Depression of the 1930s had become the right place to start any analysis of what was going on in the business cycle. And so it has proven to be for the past twenty years,\n",

    "Therefore we start with John Hick's 1937 IS-Equation, from his article \"Mr. Keynes and the 'Classics': A Suggested Interpretation\" <https://tinyurl.com/20181208a-delong>. The variable on the left-hand side is aggregate demand AD. The variable on the right-hand side is the long-term risky real interest rate r. In between are a large host of parameters drawn from the macroeconomy's behavioral relationships and from salient features of the macroeconomic environment and macroeconomic policy. We identity aggregate demand AD with national income and product Y, arguing that the inventory-adjustment mechanism will make the two equal at the macroeconomy's short-run sticky-price Keynesian equilibrium within a few quarters of a year. Then we have not so much a model of the macroeconomy as a filing system for factors that we can and need to model, thus:\n",

    "\n",
    "And we usually use \"$\\Delta$\" to stand for changes in economic quantities generated by shifts in the economic policy and in the economic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the problem of understanding Italy today, the pieces of this equation that matter are:\n",
